## SafeHouse

The heart of this course is to prototype a novel user interface following the course theme: Crisis Management, Response, and Recovery.

### Problem Statement

When a natural disaster occurs, people wonder about the safety of their family members if they are near the affected area. It may be a hassle for the affected person to reach out individually, and general social media might involve too large of an audience for them (i.e. Facebook's "Mark As Safe"). Our application, SafeHouse, intends to provide a specialized interface for this notifying task.
