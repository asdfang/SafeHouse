## SafeHouse

The heart of this course is to prototype a novel user interface following the course theme: Crisis Management, Response, and Recovery. Our app, SafeHouse, is a notifying app that accomplishes three main tasks:

1. A parent sees a display of family members and their safety statuses in the appâ€™s interface. 
2. A parent asks a child if they are safe through a push notification in the app, which the child can respond to.
3. A child was in the area of a natural disaster, and can set their safety status for other family members to see through the app before another family member explicitly asks.


### Problem Statement

When a natural disaster occurs, people wonder about the safety of their family members if they are near the affected area. It may be a hassle for the affected person to reach out individually, and general social media might involve too large of an audience for them (i.e. Facebook's "Mark As Safe"). Our application, SafeHouse, intends to provide a specialized and efficient interface for family members to quickly check on one another.
